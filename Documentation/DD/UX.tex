\section{UX - User Experience and Interface Design}

This Section describes the User Experience, meaning all the webpages that a customer will be able to reach and all the functionalities he will have access to.
\newline
We used a Class Diagram with three stereotypes:
\begin {itemize}
\item \textbf{Screen:} represents regular webpages, like the HomePages.
\item \textbf{Input Form:} represents input fields, like the standard email-password form used to log in.
\item \textbf{Regular Classes $($no stereotype$)$:} represents the Classes that are present in the regular Class Diagram.
\end {itemize} 




We divided our UX Diagram in three parts, in order to better highlight the connections between specified pages which have related fuctionalities.

\subsection{Log In and data editing}
As shown in the diagram below, when someone opens either the website or the app he gets to the Guest's HomePage. Here he can call a taxi with the Instant Call function or fill the Input Form to Log In, in order to have access to the User's functions. Also a Guest that hasn't registered before can click on the Sign Up button that will take him to the dedicated webpage, where he can fill the fields and perform the registration.\newline
Taxi Drivers $($only via app$)$ can perform their special Log In to get to the Driver's special HomePage. \newline
Users can also modify their data getting into the User Profile webpage and modifying an Input Form similar to the Sign Up one.
