		The Sign Up function is implemented by the ClientManager. Using the User Access interface, that has the method PARLACOLDB, it comunicates with the UserDataManager and saves the new User's data.
		
		\subsubsection{User LogIn}
		The LogIn is performed by the ClientManager that, as in the Sign Up, communicates with the UserDataManager through the User Access Interface.

		\subsubsection{User edit information}
		Similarly to the LogIn function the ClientManager communicates with the Data Manager. Here the Profile Editor, through the DBAccess Interface's method CAMBIADATI updates the User's data.
