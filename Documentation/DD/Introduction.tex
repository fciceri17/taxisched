\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
	This DD is a specification document intended to outline the design choices being made to implement "myTaxiService". This includes a detailed component view, information about 
	patterns used and stylistic choices, a description of the algorithms to be used and an overview of the UI. These specifications are for the developers that will be writing the code
	for the service.
\subsection{Scope}
	This service will require the development of the following:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Client-Side] \hfill
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A mobile application for customers
				\item A web interface for customers to access the service
				\item A mobile application for taxi drivers to interact with calls.
			\end{itemize}
		\item[Server-Side] \hfill
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A server application that handles live queues
				\item A database that stores user data, including credentials
				\item Another database that handles Registered user rides, memorizing both booked rides and past itineraries
			\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document Structure}
	The remainder of the document is divided into the following sections:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The introduction, which contains basic information on how the service works
	\item Architectural description, where the components of the service are described, along with the different views, the stylistic choices and the design choices taken. 
	\item Algorithm design, the section where a basic description of the algorithms being used is given.
	\item UX, the section concerning the UI design choices accompanied by some mockups.
