\section{Program Stubs and Test Data Required}

In order to perform integration testing prior to the actual deployment, a handful of components have to be simulated, and several objects must be instantiated to perform our test.
This includes, for example a functioning database, along with created users and drivers. In the following page, we will list what we will need to be created prior to the tests.

\begin{description}

	\item[Database:] we will need a functioning database, with a functioning configuration, mimicking that one of the version that will be deployed. The test data in this database shall include
	mock users, taxi drivers, and an access interface that enables the creation of rides as well as trigger based notifications.
	\item[A running server:] this server will handle incoming requests from the mock client, as well as sending ride requests to the database and elaborating shared ride locks to create and
	complete orders
	\item[A mock client:] this client will run in order to simulated user requests which are required for all tests involving the client and its sub-components. 
	\item[A driver instance:] which will be used to test driver functions.
