\section{Overall Descriptions}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
	\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
		
	\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
		A home page, where you can instantly book a taxi, login and sign up. Upon logging in, according to the user type, 
		you can access user-specific functionalities, listed in section 3.
	\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
		A device with internet connectivity is required, as well as some input measure to insert user data and other information. A gps is optional
		but not mandatory, since it can communicate a user's position in order to simplify booking. This can be aided with the use of other localization
		services such as geolocalization via cell line and wifi.
	\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
		A soft keyboard can be used instead of a hardware one for input purposes. A web browser is required if the application is not available/installed
		on the device trying to make use of the service.
	\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
		An internet connection is required for all types of users of the application. 
	\subsubsection{Memory Interfaces}
		150MB of storage space for the application + cache when using the app.

\subsection{Constraints}
	\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
		Since the application is being commissioned by the government of X, there should be no issues concerning regulatory policies, since this
		application doesn't introduce any competitors, but only acts as an aid to an existing system.
	\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
		The only hardware limitations regard the availability of an internet connection, since the service cannot operate without one. Therefore, devices
		with no connectivity can't make use of the application.
	\subsubsection{Interfaces to other applications}
		myTaxiService doesn’t have to interfaces with any other applications.
	\subsubsection{Parallel operation}
		The service shall be able to function independent of how many users may be using the application at any time.
	\subsubsection{Safety and Security Considerations}
		Due to privacy issues, the identity of customers shall be protected at all stages. Therefore, the identity of customers going on shared
		rides shall not know the identity of other customers ahead of time. Also, when accessing logs via the web interface, the database shall never
		return information about customers different from the one requesting it.
