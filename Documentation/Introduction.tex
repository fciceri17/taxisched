\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
	This RASD is a specification document intended to outline the measures being taken to implement "myTaxiService", a service which will be used
	by taxis in the city of X in order to facilitate taxi usage for drivers and customers. These specifications are for the government of X, the
	future provider of this service, and the developers that will create the applications to support the service.
%\endsubsection   
\subsection{Scope}
	\subsubsection{Software}
		This service will require the development of the following:
		\begin{description}
			\item[Client-Side] \hfill
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A mobile application for customers
					\item A web interface for customers and drivers to access the service
					\item A mobile application for taxi drivers to interact with calls.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Server-Side] \hfill
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A server application that handles live queues
					\item A database that stores user data, including credentials
					\item Another database that handles REGISTERED user rides, memorizing both booked rides and past itineraries
				\end{itemize}
		\end{description}
		The application should distinguish between regular users and drivers, and should automatically queue booked rides.
	%\endsubsubsection
	\subsubsection{Applications} %todo goals
		This service is intended to simplify the process of acquring a taxi in X. It should remove the need of a human operator
	%\endsubsubsection
	\subsubsection{Goals}
		The service should allow users to do the following things:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
		\item 
		\end{enumerate}
			
	%\endsubsubsection

\subsection{Overview}
	This document is followed by a few more sections.
	The next section describes the service's structure, how the service operates, what each type of user can do and the way the
	back-end infrastructure operates. \\
	The following one analyses what is going to be required to make the actual application work.
	The final sections are composed of  use case and sequence diagrams intended to describe the application's behavior upon user
	interaction.
