Several issues arose analyzing the length of lines of code. In more than one instance, these not only exceeded the 80 character standard, but even the 120 character limit. Examples inlude
lines 135-136, 154, 301, 320. In these cases, the length of the methods being called was too long and fragmenting the code would look very dirty. Curiously, at line 143 there seesm to be
a typing mistake, where almost 40 empty spaces appear at the end of the line of code. \\
In other cases, like lines 218 and 297, the lines of code are longer than 80 characters but only marginally so, under the 120 character recommendation.
