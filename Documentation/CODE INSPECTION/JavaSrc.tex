\subsection{Java Source Files}

During our analysis two problems arose with the java source files. The first problem was improper implementation. While both classes implemented an abstract class, 	only one of them
properly overrides the methods. In the WebServiceProviderHandler class, method 1(line 107) and the inner class (line 101)
\begin{lstlisting}
	public Class<? extends Annotation>[] 
	getTypeDependencies()
\end{lstlisting}

are both missing the @Override flag.

Also, the javadoc is incomplete for a few private methods, method 2 and method 3. While not mandatory, it is incoherent. Firstly, it is only written for one of two methods.
Furthermore, in the case of method 3, at lines 589-591, the javadoc only semantically explains the behavior of the code. The significance of the parameter and of the return value are not
explicitly stated. The same thing happens in the WebServiceProviderHandler class, where the same methods exist and are documented in the same manner.
\\
Another problem found with the document was the length of method 1. While it is mostly just calls to other methods, in some cases it is a long list checks being done within the code. Each
one of these if-statement chains could have been moved to a separate method, for clarity and an easier comprehension of the code.
