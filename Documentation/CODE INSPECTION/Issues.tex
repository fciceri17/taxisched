\section{Code Issues}

Qualcosa come intro

From now on in this section, we will change the way how we call the methods in order to simplify the reading and the comprehension. \newline
In particular we will refer to the method:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{HandlerProcessingResult processAnnotation $($AnnotationInfo annInfo$)$} as Method 1
	\item \textit{Boolean ignoreWebserviceAnnotations $($AnnotatedElement annElem,AnnotatedElementHandler annCtignoreWebserviceAnnotationsx$)$} as Method 2 
	\item \textit{Boolean isJaxwsRIDeployment $($AnnotationInfo annInfo$)$} as Method 3
\end{itemize}
