\subsection{Class and Interface Declarations}

Classes are correctly done and there are no issues with the declarations barring the notation errors described in the previous subsection. However, there seems to be some duplicate code
in the WebServiceHandler class and the WebServiceProviderHandler class, where methods are duplicated. While method 1 is different in each file, methods 2 and 3 are exactly the same, and
as a result should be placed in another class that may be accessed by both.
Furthermore the order in which methods 2 and 3 are within the 2 analyzed classes is inverted, which seems to be an incoherent choice.
