\subsection{Initializations and declarations}

Declarations and initializations are mostly done in the right way. The only problem noticed is that in Method 1 there are a lot of declarations that aren't at the beginning, 
but could be a right choice in order to make the code more readeable; being the method very long, create all the variables hundrends of lines before using them could confuse.
