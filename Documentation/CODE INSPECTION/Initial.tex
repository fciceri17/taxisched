\subsection{Initializations and declarations}

Declarations and initializations are mostly done in the right way. The only problem noticed is that in Method 1 there are a lot of declarations that aren't at the beginning. 
This can still be the right choice in order to make the code more readable; since the method is very long, creating all the variables hundreds of lines before using them could be
confusing.
