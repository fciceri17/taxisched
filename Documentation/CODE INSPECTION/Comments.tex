\subsection{Comments}
Most comments are well placed and help clarify the code in the analyzed methods. However, in some instances the code like at line 155, some comments come across as unprofessional, with
improper usage of exclamation marks and the like. Also, the comment in line 604(method 2) does not clearly explain what the program does when an exception is caught.
